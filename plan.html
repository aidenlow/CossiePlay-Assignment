<h1>CP1406 - Assignment 1 - Project Plan - CossiePlay</h1>
<p><strong>Name:</strong> ... Aiden Low<br>

<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>The purpose of this website will be to increase the total number of costume sales and also to increase the amount of people going to the cosplay party. The website is needed because the business only makes 4 costumes a week and has only around 30 people attend the parties, the business states that this is not enough. The website will provide the public with all the information and pricing they need to hopefully make a purchase or attend the cosplay party, resulting in the business expanding. </p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>Success evaluation will be done by measuring both the amount of people attending the cosplay party and the number of costumes being ordered each week. Then compare this to the values obtained before the site was implemented to determine if the website was successful or not. </p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>The target audience for the website will be ages 14 through to 30. The business has specified that they already have customers from the ages of 35-50 so we do not want to target this demographic. To appeal to this audience the site must be: easy to navigate, clickable items must be noticeable, a strong call to action, the overall layout will be wide. Lastly, this is a cosplay website, therefore the colours are going to be very bold.</p>
